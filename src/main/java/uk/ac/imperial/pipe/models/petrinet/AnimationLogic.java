/**
 * Contains methods which deal with the logic of animation or running an {@link ExecutablePetriNet}, 
 * for instance, which transitions are enabled for a given state.  This may be used both for analysis purposes
 * and for execution purposes (animation or running an executable Petri net).  When animating or running 
 * an executable Petri net, the state of the executable Petri net may be changed.  When performing analysis,
 * multiple different States may be processed, other than the current State.  Therefore, many methods have two flavors:
 * <ul>
 * <li> someProcessing():  performs some processing against the current State of the ExecutablePetriNet.  
 * This may include updating the current State.
 * <li> someProcessing(State state):  performs some processing against the given state, as if it were the state of 
 * the ExecutablePetriNet.  The current State of the ExecutablePetriNet, however, is neither referenced nor updated. 
 * </ul>    
 * </p>This interface has two implementations.  For most use cases, including normal analysis and execution, use
 * {@link PetriNetAnimationLogic}.  For some limited analysis purposes, {@link SimpleAnimationLogic} may be appropriate.
